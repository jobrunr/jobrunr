# Welcome to the JobRunr community!

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm [Ronald](https://github.com/rdehuyss), the creator and lead engineer of [JobRunr](https://www.jobrunr.io/). Nice to meet you! Who are you?

JobRunr is an open-source project where we try to make a living from, so we kindly ask you to have a **complete Github Personal Profile** (Name and Company details or LinkedIn Profile). It's always nice to know to whom we're talking to and providing free support to. If your Github Profile is not complete, we will probably close the issue without answering. For more info, read this excellent blog post about [open-source etiquette](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).

* Before you send out the pull request, please sync your forked repository with remote repository, this will make your pull request simple and clear. See guide below:

git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
git checkout -b your_awesome_patch
... add some work
