            JobRunr detected that your poll interval in seconds setting is too small - are you perhaps scheduling a lot

            It means that the BackgroundJob Master node cannot execute all relevant tasks like scheduling recurring jobs
            and doing maintenance tasks like deleting succeeded jobs.
